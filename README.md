# CS50x-solutions

Hello, these are my CS50x projets solutions so far. I started on 14.7.2023 with 0 to very little previous coding experience. 
I am currently at week3, working on Tidmean pset3.

I didn't include week0 since it is only scratch.

If you are taking CS50x feel free to inspirate with my solutions. As I am still learning some of the projects are really hard coded, but they all work!

## Future Plans

- Optimize solutions for previous projects (I might as well leave the first solutions, so you can see what should you expect to be able to do after nth Lecture, but idk now)
- Sharing my other projects from my coding journey

I welcome contributions, bug reports, and feedback from the community.
