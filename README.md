# CS50x-solutions

Hello, these are my CS50x projets solutions so far. I've currently finished second problem set in week3 (working on tideman atm) and will be uploading solutions of all projects in the upcoming weeks.

Feel free to inspirate. As I am still learning some of the projects are really hard coded, but they work!
In future I will probably upload optimized solutions but I will also keep here the hardcoded ones because that's the level of coding ewxperience I had after the nth C lecture and you can reflect better on what should you be able to do after first lecture if you are taking CS50x.
