# CS50x-solutions

Hello, these are my CS50x projets solutions so far. I started on 14.7.2023 with 0 to very little previous coding experience. 

I didn't include week0 since it is only scratch.

If you are taking CS50x feel free to inspirate with my solutions. As I am still learning some of the projects are really hard coded, but they all work!

## Projects by Week

### Week 1

- [Practice Problems](week1/practiceproblems)
- [Lab 1](week1/lab1)
- [Problem Set 1](week1/pset1/)

### Week 2

- [Practice Problems](week2/practiceproblems)
- [Lab 2](week2/lab2)
- [Problem Set 2](week2/pset2)

### Week 3

- [Practice Problems](week3/practiceproblems)
- [Lab 3](week3/lab3/)
- [Problem Set 3](week3/pset3)
- I've decied to skip Tideman for now since I couldnt figure out the locked_pair function in 6 days for now. I will come back to it later perhaps.

### Week 4

- [Practice Problems](week4/practiceproblems)
- [Lab 4](week4/lab4)
- [Problem Set 4](week4/pset4)

[More Weeks...]

## Future Plans

- Optimize solutions for previous projects (I might as well leave the first solutions, so you can see what should you expect to be able to do after nth Lecture, but idk now)
- Sharing my other projects from my coding journey

## Contributions

I welcome contributions, bug reports, and feedback from the community.
